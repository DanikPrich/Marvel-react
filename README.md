# Marvel

The project is a React-based web application that utilizes a database of Marvel Universe characters. The project was developed solely by me. Its main tasks are to display a random Marvel character along with their name, description, and photo (if available in the database), as well as to display a list of characters in the database, which can be expanded to show the last character. Clicking on a character in the list opens up their description and name, and expands a list of comics in which the character appeared. Clicking on a comic opens a separate page that displays a detailed description of the comic and its price. Additionally, there is another page on the site that generates a list of comics from the entire database, and clicking on one opens a separate page with its description and price.
